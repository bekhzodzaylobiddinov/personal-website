### Some quotes:

> Experts thrive on narrowness. When PhD students write their theses, they donâ€™t address all of politics, the stock market, or the human body, they study narrow things like the political landscape of a particular year, the valuation vs momentum debate, or how sleep affects productivity. Mastery needs a boundary.

> Don't focus on the final product, focus on the process.

> Don't let "Easy and Fun" instant gratification monkey in your head to get control. Otherwise you'll deal with Panic Monster! - Deadline- No Deadline ->

> Relying on motivation is a trap that's easy to fall into. What matters is environment. You don't lack motivation, you lack clarity. Motivation leaves you hopeful but it's vague and it's easy to make excuses for vagueness. What's helped me is the book "Atomic Habits". The formula for making a habit is a simple one: "I will (behavior) at (time) in (location). In this way you are setting a plan instead of a vague "I will work out". When? Where? By that statement being vague it's easy to excuse it because you didn't actively make a plan for it.

> Change your environment. Humans rely on vision as our most important sense. It's easier to stick to a plan if we see the tools for it.

### Killers

- I noticed that if I don't get enough sleep, my whole day will be unproductive. And it's difficult to bounce back
- Getting into social media, for instant gratification
